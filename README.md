# Data Shuttler
A "Service" in our app, that let's "Miners" users Deliver or mail Storage containing Large game files &amp; assets to other users in their City!

# Accelerate Game Installs:
The Customer chooses all games they want to Play! They pay an upfront fee, or over time with added insurance to cover the cost of the Storage Borrowed - Then a "miner" with Fast Internet in their city Generates and delivers a drive to them!

# Upload Large Files to my UniCloud
Can also work for Photographers who want to Edit online, and need a Data Shuttle to upload their footage!

# Offsite Backup
Schedule an Offsite Backup data Pickup!


Inspiration: DoorDash, UberEats, Shipt.


# Security:
Security Core to our Design!

All Miners who offer DataShuttler have to run a QubesOS instance that Generates Encrypted Storage Media!
We deliver them an Encryption key, to lock LUKS with.

The User ordering has 1/n the Key to decrypt it on their local device or phone! And their UniWallet Vault on the Blockchain has the other 1/n. Authenticator can provide an optional 3rd! When they combine the 2 and used Authenticator It Unlocks the drive!

LUKS makes this simple, with Encryption keys in Superblock can be changed without rewriting data!
