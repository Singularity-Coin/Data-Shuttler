# Game-Install-Accelerator
A "Service" in our app, that let's "Miners" users Deliver or mail Storage containing Large game files &amp; assets to other users in their City!


The Customer chooses all games they want to Play! They pay an upfront fee, or over time with added insurance to cover the cost of the Storage Borrowed - Then a "miner" with Fast Internet in their city Generates and delivers a drive to them!

Can also work for Photographers who want to Edit online, and need a Data Shuttle to upload their footage!

Inspiration: DoorDash, UberEats, Shipt.
